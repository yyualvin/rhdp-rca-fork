# Root Cause Analysis

Investigate failed jobs by correlating Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) job logs with Splunk OCP pod logs and analyzing AgnosticD/AgnosticV configuration to identify root causes.

## Automatic Execution

When a user asks to analyze a failed job, execute these steps automatically.
The skill's base path is provided when this skill is invoked. Run scripts relative to this folder.

### Preflight Check (run before first analysis)

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies (if .venv doesn't exist)
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -q -r requirements.txt

# Check all prerequisites (use --json for structured output)
.venv/bin/python scripts/cli.py setup --json
```

Review the JSON output. Some settings are required, others are optional:

**Required** (skill will not proceed without these):
- **JOB_LOGS_DIR** -- Local directory for job log files
- **JUMPBOX_URI** -- SSH jumpbox connection for uploading analysis results and feedback

**Recommended** (analysis works without these but functionality is reduced):
- **MLFlow** -- Tracing configuration for recording analysis runs (MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI, MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME, MLFLOW_TAG_USER)

**Optional** (skill runs with reduced functionality when missing):
- **SSH / REMOTE_HOST** not configured: `--fetch` flag won't work (user must provide logs in JOB_LOGS_DIR manually)
- **Splunk** not configured: Steps 2-3 (log correlation) will be skipped
- **GitHub token** not configured: Step 4 (config fetching) will be skipped
- **pgvector** not configured: Completed RCAs won't be embedded for historical similarity search (set `PGVECTOR_HOST`, `PGVECTOR_DB_NAME`, `PGVECTOR_DB_USER`, `PGVECTOR_DB_PASSWORD`; optional `PGVECTOR_TABLE`, defaults to `rca_analysis_embeddings`)

#### Interactive Setup for Missing Configs

If any checks have `"status": "missing"` and `"configurable": true`, offer to help the user configure them:

1. List the missing configurable items grouped by check name
2. Ask: "Would you like me to help configure these? I'll walk you through each one."
3. If yes, for each missing check with `"configurable": true`:
   - Show the check name and each `env_vars[].prompt` to explain what's needed
   - If the env var has a `"default"`, mention it (user can press enter to accept)
   - If the env var has `"optional": true`, let the user know they can skip it
   - Ask the user for the value
   - **SSH special handling**: If the SSH check has `"ssh_setup_needed": true`:
     - Ask the user for their SSH host alias name
     - Check if that alias already exists in `~/.ssh/config` -- if so, use it as `REMOTE_HOST`
     - If it doesn't exist, ask: do you want to create a new SSH config entry? If yes, ask for: hostname, username, port (default 22), and optional identity file path
     - Read `~/.ssh/config`, append the new `Host` block, and write it back
     - Then set `REMOTE_HOST` to the alias name
4. After collecting all values, read the project's `.claude/settings.json` file
5. Merge the new values into the `"env"` block (create it if it doesn't exist)
6. If MLflow env vars were configured (MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI, MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME), also add the required MLflow hooks to the `"hooks"` block (create it if it doesn't exist):
   ```json
   "hooks": {
     "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "INPUT=$(cat); SESSION_ID=$(echo \"$INPUT\" | jq -r '.session_id'); echo \"export CLAUDE_SESSION_ID='$SESSION_ID'\" >> \"$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE\""
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "if [ \"$MLFLOW_CLAUDE_TRACING_ENABLED\" = \"true\" ]; then if ! pip show mlflow >/dev/null 2>&1; then pip install mlflow; fi; fi"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python -c \"from mlflow.claude_code.hooks import stop_hook_handler; stop_hook_handler()\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
   }
   ```
7. Write the updated settings file
8. Tell the user to **restart the Claude Code session** for env vars and hooks to take effect
9. **Important**: Write secrets (tokens, passwords) to `.claude/settings.json` -- ensure this file is in `.gitignore`

If checks show non-configurable errors (e.g., venv issues, rsync not found), provide the fix command instead.

#### MLFlow Server Startup

The `MLFlow server` preflight check automatically handles server connectivity:
- If the server is unreachable and `JUMPBOX_URI` is configured, it starts an SSH tunnel automatically
- If the tunnel is already running, it skips startup
- If the tunnel fails, it reports the error but the skill can still proceed (MLFlow is recommended, not required)

If any **required** checks (JOB_LOGS_DIR, JUMPBOX_URI) are still missing after the setup flow, do **not** proceed to analysis -- tell the user what's still needed. If MLFlow is missing, warn that tracing won't be recorded but proceed. If all required checks pass (recommended/optional items may remain missing), proceed to analysis.

### Step 1-4: Run the analysis CLI

Always use `--fetch` when analyzing by job ID. This automatically downloads the log from the remote server if it's not already present locally, and skips fetching if the log is already there.

```bash
# By job ID (auto-fetches log from remote if not found locally)
.venv/bin/python scripts/cli.py analyze --job-id <JOB_ID> --fetch

# By explicit path (when you already have the log file)
.venv/bin/python scripts/cli.py analyze --job-log <path-to-job-log>
```

The `cli.py analyze` command automatically runs all steps:

- **Step 1**: Parse job log → Extract job ID, GUID, namespace, failed tasks, time window
- **Step 2**: Query Splunk → Fetch pod logs from namespace within job time window
- **Step 3**: Correlate → Merge AAP and Splunk events into unified timeline
- **Step 4**: Fetch GitHub files → Parse job metadata, fetch AgnosticV configs and AgnosticD workload code (requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be configured)

**Outputs**: `.analysis/<job-id>/step1_job_context.json`, `step2_splunk_logs.json`, `step3_correlation.json`, `step4_github_fetch_history.json`

This skill automatically searches for job logs in the configured `JOB_LOGS_DIR`.


#### Manual Usage

From this skill's directory:

```bash
# Setup virtual environment (one time)
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Analyze by job ID (auto-fetches log if needed, runs steps 1-4)
.venv/bin/python scripts/cli.py analyze --job-id 1234567 --fetch

# Or analyze with explicit path
.venv/bin/python scripts/cli.py analyze --job-log /path/to/job_123.json.gz
```

**GitHub MCP Verification**: If step4 output contains `"error": "all_paths_failed"` or any error status (e.g., `"status": "404"`, `"status": "timeout"`, `"status": "500"`) in `paths_tried` arrays, reasoning errors using MCP tools. See [github_mcp_verification.md](github_mcp_verification.md) for complete verification process.

## Step 5: Analyze and Generate Summary (Claude's task)

**Input**: Read the following files in order:
1. **REQUIRED**: `step1_job_context.json` - Job metadata and failed task details
2. **REQUIRED**: `step3_correlation.json` - Correlated timeline with relevant pod logs (DO NOT read step2 unless needed)
3. **REQUIRED**: `step4_github_fetch_history.json` - Configuration and code context
4. **CONDITIONAL**: `step2_splunk_logs.json` - Only read if step3 indicates errors needing deeper investigation

**Output**: `.analysis/<job-id>/step5_analysis_summary.json` 

**Post-Step 5 Actions**: After saving the summary, you MUST run these commands:

```bash
# Upload analysis to the Jumpbox
python scripts/cli.py upload --job-id <job-id>

# Store the completed RCA in the memory layer for historical similarity search
# (best-effort: skips cleanly when PGVECTOR_* is not configured)
python scripts/cli.py embed --job-id <job-id>
```

### Analysis Guidelines

**Configuration Analysis**:
- Variable precedence: common.yaml → {platform}/account.yaml → {platform}/{catalog_item}/common.yaml
   → {platform}/{catalog_item}/{env}.yaml (later overrides earlier)
- Check for conflicts, missing variables, secrets references (`includes/secrets`, `!vault`)

**Task Analysis**:
- Task action patterns: `kubernetes.core.k8s_info` (RBAC/resource), `ansible.builtin.uri` (network/auth), `command/shell` (paths/permissions)
- Duration: <30s (immediate failure), 30-300s (short retry), >300s (long retry/timeout)
- Time correlation: Pod error before/during/after task indicates infrastructure vs task-triggered issue
- Conditional execution: Check if `when:` conditions executed incorrectly (variable precedence issue)

### Summary Requirements

1. **Root Cause**: Category (`configuration|infrastructure|workload_bug|credential|resource|dependency`), summary, confidence
2. **Evidence**: Supporting evidence from AAP logs, Splunk logs, and GitHub configs/code
   - **REQUIRED**: When `source` is `agnosticv_config` or `agnosticd_code`, **MUST** include `github_path` in format `owner/repo:path/to/file.yml:line`
   - Extract GitHub paths from step4:
     - **Configs**: From `step4.github_fetches[].fetched_configs.{purpose}.path` → construct as `{config_owner}/{config_repo}:{path}` (e.g., `example-org/config-repo:platform/account.yaml`)
     - **Workloads**: From `step4.github_fetches[].location.parsed` → construct as `{owner}/{repo}:{file_path}:{line_number}` (e.g., `example-org/workload-repo:roles/example-role/tasks/main.yml:42`)
3. **Correlation**: How AAP logs link to Splunk (GUID, namespace, timestamps, pod names)
4. **Recommendations**: Specific file changes with paths, actions, and reasons
   - **Include `github_path`** in recommendations when referencing GitHub files (format: `owner/repo:path/to/file.yml:line`)

**Note**: Job details, failed tasks, and configuration data are available in step1 and step4 files - reference them rather than duplicating in the summary.
